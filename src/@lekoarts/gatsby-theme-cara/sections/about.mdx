Next.js, React, TypeScript, Python, Django, PostgreSQL 

Being a self taught developer, I learned how to motivate myself to keep pushing until a solution is found. I went to Rutgers University for operatic singing which taught me discipline, hard work and perseverance. I was introduced to new languages: German, French and Italian which all had to be perfected, long before even looking at a new piece of music! Music training (specifically aural skills) really taught me how to think computationally and work diligently when I decided I wanted to learn how to code in 2019. The journey has been challenging, yet rewarding and I am proud of how far I have come as a developer and to have the ability to help make others happy through the limitless possibilities technology can offer!

I've used Django with Python at Ernst & Young for a custom data-cleaning application. Upon login, users were able to retrieve monthly spreadsheets provided by HR on employee data. It retrieved over 3,000 cleaned logs in under 2 seconds, and utilized Pandas AI for data manipulation and organization. Also depending on the level of authority, 'read and write' permissions were granted to managerial roles to manage the data, while entry-level employees were only given 'read' permissions. After early completion of this application in under 6 weeks, with an initial 3 month timeframe, my contract was extended for a 4th month as I had reduced manual labor by 95% and human error rates by 99.99%.

I am honored to be able to help companies and small businesses find a greater online presence and offer personalized websites to fit each case. It's never a one-size-fits-all and I would love to help you tailor your website to your unique vision!
